 How does vegetative composition affect air and surface temperature? 

Team Name: To Be Determined (TBD) Group
Team Members: Bree, Katie, 

Hypothesis: We predict that surface and air temperatures will be lower when there is dense vegetation present. We expect denser 
vegetative strucutre to keep surface and air temperatures cooler.  Thus, the variables are expected to have a linearly negative
relationship.

Plan Hypothesis: We plan to observe surface & air temperatures, as well as vegetitation structure, in two areas of Colorado. We will 
use surface and air temperature data from the CPER site as well as the RMNP site.  By taking the difference in air and surface temperature,
we will get .  Using the difference, we will compare it to the two sites.  We will see temperature to expect from a grass field versus a
a forest.


Data Description: There is data in NEON for two Colorado sites, CPER & RMNP. 
CPER is more of a mountian range with trees, while RMNP is a grass field. 
We will be looking for correlations between different vegatation structures and surface temperatures in those two sites.

NEON Citations: These three are our main ones. There may be more added in the future.
● Vegetation structure (DP1.10098.001)
● Soil heat flux (DP1.00040.001)
● Single aspirated air temperature (DP1.00002.001)
