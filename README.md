# TBD Group
 How does vegetative composition affect air and surface temperature? 

Team Name: To Be Determined (TBD) Group
Team Members: Bree, Katie, 

Hypothesis: We predict that surface temperatures will be lower when there is dense vegetation present.

Plan Hypothesis: We plan to observe surface & air temperatures, as well as vegetitation structure, in two areas of Colorado. 


Data Description: There is data in NEON for two Colorado sites, CPER & RMNP. 
CPER is more of a mountian range with trees, while RMNP is a grass field. 
We will be looking for correlations between different vegatation structures and surface temperatures in those two sites.

NEON Citations: These three are our main ones. There may be more added in the future.
● Vegetation structure (DP1.10098.001)
● Soil heat flux (DP1.00040.001)
● Single aspirated air temperature (DP1.00002.001)
