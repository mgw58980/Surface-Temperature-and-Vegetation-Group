# TBD Group
 How does vegetative composition affect air and surface temperature? 

Team Name: TBD Group
Team Members: Bree, Katie, Jess

Hypothesis: We predict that surface temperatures will be lower when there is dense vegetation present.

Plan Hypothesis: We plan to observe surface & air temperatures, as well as vegetitation structure, in two areas of Colorado. 
There is data in NEON for two Colorado sites, CPER & RMNP. CPER is more of a mountian range with trees, while RMNP is a grass field. 
We will be looking for correlations between different vegatation structures and surface temperatures in those two sites.
