 How does vegetative composition affect air and surface temperature? 

Team Name: To Be Determined (TBD) Group
Team Members: Bree, Katie, Jess

Hypothesis: We predict that surface and air temperatures will be lower when there is dense vegetation present. We expect denser 
vegetative strucutre to keep surface and air temperatures cooler.  Thus, the variables are expected to have a linearly negative
relationship.

Plan Hypothesis: We plan to observe surface & air temperatures, as well as vegetitation structure, in two areas of Colorado. We will 
use surface and air temperature data from the CPER site as well as the RMNP site.  By taking the difference in air and surface temperature,
we will be able to determine the effect of ground cover on surface temperature.  This will help us control for differences in air 
temperature. Using the difference, we will compare the temperature to the two sites.  We will see temperature to expect from a grass 
field versus a forest.  This should give us valuable information on how vegetative structure of an environment effects temperature 
and heat.  We will look at figures generated from our data with temperature as our independent variable and density of vegetation 
as our dependent variable.


Data Description: Our data includes air and surface temperature recordings collected from two NEON sites in Colorado, CPER and RMNP. 
CPER is a site with mountian ranges and trees, while RMNP is a grass field. Data is available from both sites from 2017 until 2023. Air
temperature was measured using NEON site towers with sensors to record temperature profiles.  Soil temperature was measured by using 
a platinum resistant thermometer placed a various depths within the soil. 
We will be looking for correlations between different vegatation structures and surface temperatures in those two sites.

NEON Citations: These three are our main ones. There may be more added in the future.
● Vegetation structure (DP1.10098.001)
● Soil heat flux (DP1.00040.001)
● Single aspirated air temperature (DP1.00002.001)
