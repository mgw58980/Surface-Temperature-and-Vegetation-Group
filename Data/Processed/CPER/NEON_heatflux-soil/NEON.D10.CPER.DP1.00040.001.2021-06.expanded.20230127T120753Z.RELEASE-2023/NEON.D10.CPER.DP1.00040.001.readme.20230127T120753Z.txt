DATA PRODUCT INFORMATION

------------------------



ID: NEON.DOM.SITE.DP1.00040.001



Name: Soil heat flux plate



Description: The amount of thermal energy moving by conduction across an area of soil in a unit of time. Measured at three of the five sensor-based soil plots at each terrestrial site..



NEON Science Team Supplier: Terrestrial Instrument System



Abstract: Soil heat flux is the amount of thermal energy that moves by conduction across an area of soil in a unit of time and usually expressed in Watts per square meter. This data product represents the soil heat flux at the locations of the heat flux plates below the soil surface. It is reported as 1-minute mean measurements and 30-minute mean values. Sensors were initially installed at ~8 cm deep at most sites and are in the process of being moved to ~5 cm deep.

Latency:
Data collected in any given month are published during the second full week of the following month.



Brief Design Description: The soil heat flux data product is available at all NEON TIS sites. At each site, soil heat flux sensors are distributed within three of the five soil plots within the TIS soil array.



Brief Study Area Description: Soil heat flux is measured at all of NEON's soil plots at terrestrial sites. Sensor depths and orientations can be found in the "…sensor_positions…" file in the data product download package. zOffset represents sensor depth in meters relative to the soil surface (negative numbers indicate the sensor is below the soil surface). Pitch represents the maximum tilt, in degrees, of the heat flux plate from horizontal. Azimuth represents the direction of the maximum tilt, in degrees, relative to true north. Each row corresponds to a different heat flux sensor installed at the site as indicated in the HOR.VER column. For example, 3.501 in the HOR.VER column refers to the sensor in soil plot 3 measurement level 1 (there is currently just one measurement level for this data product).

ISSUE LOG

----------



This log provides a list of issues that were identified during data collection or processing, prior to publication of this data package. For a more recent log, please visit this data product's detail page at https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.00040.001.



Issue Date: 2022-09-13
Issue: Severe flooding destroyed several roads into Yellowstone National Park in June 2022, making the YELL and BLDE sites inaccessible to NEON staff. Preventive and corrective maintenance are not being performed, nor is the annual exchange of sensors for calibration and validation. While automated quality control routines are likely to detect and flag most issues, users are advised to review data carefully.
       Date Range: 2022-06-12 to 2022-12-31
       Location(s) Affected: YELL
Resolution Date: 
Resolution: 

Issue Date: 2022-08-25
Issue: Sensor calibration file was not uploaded to database causing data unavailability since the replacement sensor was installed.
       Date Range: 2021-12-14 to 2022-08-25
       Location(s) Affected: SJER soil plot 5 (HOR.VER: 005.501)
Resolution Date: 2022-08-25
Resolution: Calibration file was uploaded and data have been scheduled for reprocessing and publication

Issue Date: 2022-06-02
Issue: During an effort to reinstall the soil heat fluxes to a depth of 5cm compared to the original install of 8cm, the flux plates were found to already be at ~5cm depth. Likely erosion over time is responsible for the decrease in depth. Sensor location was updated with date of verification but changes to depth occurred at unknown times prior.
       Date Range: 2016-02-01 to 2021-09-30
       Location(s) Affected: SERC Soil Plot 1 and Soil Plot 3 (020.000, 030.000)
       Date Range: 2019-05-01 to 2022-03-04
       Location(s) Affected: PUUM Soil Plot 3 (030.000)
Resolution Date: 2022-06-02
Resolution: Depth corrected in database

Issue Date: 2022-01-07
Issue: Sensor regularly reporting unreasonable values
       Date Range: 2018-12-26 to 2019-07-08
       Location(s) Affected: D06 KONZ soil plot 5 (HOR.VER: 005.501)
Resolution Date: 2022-01-07
Resolution: Sensor values consistent with other nearby sensors

Issue Date: 2022-01-18
Issue: Data were reprocessed to incorporate minor and/or isolated corrections to quality control thresholds, sensor installation periods, geolocation data, and manual quality flags.
       Date Range: 2013-01-01 to 2021-10-01
       Location(s) Affected: All
Resolution Date: 2022-01-01
Resolution: Reprocessed provisional data are available now. Reprocessed data previously included in RELEASE-2021 will become available when RELEASE-2022 is issued.

Issue Date: 2021-01-14
Issue: Safety measures to protect personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in reduced or canceled maintenance activities for extended periods at NEON sites. Data availability and/or quality may be negatively impacted during this time.

In addition, the annual refresh of sensors and data acquisition systems (DAS) did not occur according to the typical 1-year schedule for many sites. The annual refresh is where freshly calibrated and verified sensors and DAS replace the units in the field.
       Date Range: 2020-03-23 to 2021-12-31
       Location(s) Affected: ALL
Resolution Date: 2021-12-31
Resolution: NEON reviewed data from all sites and time periods potentially impacted by COVID-19 safety precautions to identify and manually flag suspect data that escaped automated quality tests. Suspect data are indicated by the final quality flag in the data files, which should be used to inform data filtering prior to use. 

Currently, there are no quality flags indicating lack of conformance to an annual sensor refresh interval, but these are in development. Data during this time period should be treated as valid unless marked suspect by other quality flags.

Issue Date: 2021-03-02
Issue: Likely sensor malfunction identified during data review. Implausibly positive heat flux at all times, inconsistent with other sensors.
       Date Range: 2019-05-01 to 2021-05-01
       Location(s) Affected: ORNL soil plot 5 (005.501)
Resolution Date: 2021-07-12
Resolution: Manual flagging applied in provisional data and RELEASE-2022 and later. Note that data prior to 2020-07 in this issue log will remain unflagged in RELEASE-2021.

Issue Date: 2021-07-12
Issue: Sensor malfunction
       Date Range: 2021-01-01 to 2021-05-01
       Location(s) Affected: SJER soil plot 1 (001.501)
Resolution Date: 2021-07-12
Resolution: data were manually flagged

Issue Date: 2021-04-21
Issue: Sensors were installed in incorrect locations.
       Date Range: 2020-11-23 to 2021-04-01
       Location(s) Affected: UKFS(HOR.VER: 005.501, 001.501)
Resolution Date: 2021-04-21
Resolution: Data was reprocessed with correct locations.

Issue Date: 2020-03-26
Issue: Coefficients used in IS data processing to compute the uncertainty contributed by resistance or voltage readings made by the field data acquisition system (FDAS) were updated. The updated coefficients are based on a larger FDAS sample and are larger than previous estimates. Although the difference between previous uncertainty estimates and updated estimates is small, there may be periods for which the FDAS uncertainty represents the largest source of uncertainty. Data produced after the resolution date have been produced with the updated coefficients. Data prior to the resolution date will be reprocessed prior to the first NEON data release. An additional changelog comment will be entered at that time.
       Date Range: 2019-12-11 to 2019-12-11
       Location(s) Affected: All
Resolution Date: 2020-06-10
Resolution: 2019-12-11: Updated coefficients used in processing.
2020-06-10: All data reprocessed with correct coefficients.

Issue Date: 2020-03-26
Issue: The alpha and beta quality metric multipliers used for computing the final quality flag were swapped in processing. The final quality flag is raised when alphaQM*m + betaQM*n >= 20%. The multiplier m should be set to 2 and n should be set to 1, but these values were swapped, making it slightly harder to raise the final quality flag. These multipliers were corrected in data produced after the resolution date. Data prior to the resolution date will be reprocessed prior to the first NEON data release. An additional changelog comment will be entered at that time.
       Date Range: 2020-01-08 to 2020-01-08
       Location(s) Affected: All
Resolution Date: 2020-06-10
